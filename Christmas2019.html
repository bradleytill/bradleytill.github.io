    <h1>Dear Friends and Family,</h1>
    <p>Once again we are faced with the quick passage of time. Being scientists, we were intrigued by the Coriolis effect and living in the Southern Hemisphere for the first time in our lives. Our hypothesis was that things will flow in the opposite direction down here and therefore we should have gotten progressively younger over the past year. Sadly the gray hairs and creaky bones keep increasing and our hypothesis was proven wrong.</p>
    <p>Typical for most years, we kept busy. We began 2019 on an airplane returning from a trip to Oregon where we spent Christmas with Rachel’s mom and her sister Rebecca. In January we hustled to purchase a car before our nephew Alec and his dad Kevin came to visit at the end of the month.  We picked up our new Subaru the day before they arrived.  What timing! For those of you who have not yet been to Chile, if you plan on leaving the freeway, it is a good idea to have all wheel drive. We have not regretted our decision to buy a car adept at steep and muddy roads covered in potholes! We gave the car a workout with Kevin and Alec. This included a trip to the mountain resort & waterfall region of Huilo Huilo, and also Chiloe island, famous for its UNESCO wooden churches and penguin colonies.  Who doesn’t love penguins? After Kevin and Alec left us in early February, we packed in trips to the coast (Puerto Saavedra) in February, the Spanish forts and German breweries of Valdivia (in March), the waterfalls of Saltos de Laja, Concepción, and manicured European gardens in April, hiking around the Villarica volcano in Pucón in May, and the thermal springs of Peumayen in early July. Later in July we took a break from exploring Chile and headed off to Wisconsin. Brad had his 30th High School reunion (yikes!). His friends (who may be reading this) are still looking great. Everyone else is bald and saggy (ha ha ha). It was also great to spend some quality time with his parents and his brother and his family. Brad’s parents are no spring chickens and it is a little tough being so far away. Brad was back home in Chile for just a few days at the end of July before he flew to Costa Rica to teach a course on plant bioinformatics. This is a relatively new field for him and he was happy to be given the opportunity.  He had a great time teaching and hanging out with some crazy scientists from Argentina!  They scientists at the University of Costa Rica have a project on coffee genetics that Brad was involved in when he worked at the UN. So, it was also great for him to reconnect with his colleagues.  Rachel flew up after the teaching was done and they went to the Manuel Antonio National Park where they saw a ton of cool animals, including three species of monkeys, two and three-toed sloths, agoutis, capybaras, humming birds and a plethora of tropical plants. There was also time to swim in the ocean and eat some good food (why don’t they have corn tortillas in Chile?). August was also Brad’s birthday and we threw our first Chilean barbecue party at our house. Making new friends has been slow, and it was nice so many folks from work joined us to celebrate! We squeezed in what was probably the world’s muddiest hike in September at the Huerquehue National Park. The parks down here are great!   
</p>
 <p>Things changed in October. The country erupted with mass protests. This was something we had never experienced before. We were evacuated from our lab several times due to tear gas leaking in from nearby clashes between protesters and police.  We have not driven to work a single day for the past year, but take our bicycles every day.  During the worst of the protests we were bicycling through smoldering remnants of the previous night’s street bonfires, and past torn down street signs, bus stop shelters and traffic lights. There are many broken windows and graffiti across the city, especially in the center around our workplace. The past month has been calmer in our city but worse in other places. Needless to say, adjusting to a new country and culture has been a bit more difficult than it was when we moved to Austria.</p>
    <p>The good news is that things are calm outside of the cities. We escaped the madness in October and went up to Talca where we stayed at cool ecological resort,  had a great day hiking in the Altos de Lircay National Reserve, and also educated ourselves on the local wines from the Maule region, including touring the Balduzzi winery. At the beginning of December we had another great weekend in the Conguillío National Park. Did we mention we love the parks?  
</p>
 <p>By now you may be asking the question “Don’t you guys ever work?” Yes, yes we do.  We spent part of the year writing grants to get funding (before we moved here we were assured it would be much easier to get research funding than it actually is).  We have built the tools we need to do the work and are expanding our computational skills.  We are also working with our colleagues to develop a new crop, a small berry known locally as “michay”, or scientifically as Berberis darwinii.  We are excited that we finally got approval and funds to start doing some genomics on the crop.  It has a big potential for being a great crop for the local indigenous farmers and so we are excited to get things going. 
</p>
 <p>Well, that’s the news from Chile. We wish you all a wonderful holiday season and health and happiness in the New Year.
</p>
 <p>    Brad & Rachel
