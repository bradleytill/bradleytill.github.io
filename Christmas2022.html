  <h1>Dear Friends and Family,</h1>
<p>The holiday season is upon us once again. Christmas always brings with it memories of childhood: the smell of baking cookies, decorations, and opening presents with our parents. This year we are especially cherishing those memories because Brad’s mother passed away in April. There is a hint of melancholy this year, true, but also a celebration of the rich life that Jean led, and all the people she touched.  <p>   
 <p> 
<p>Like you, we were happy that restrictions lifted this past year and things started to feel a little bit more normal.  We actually got out and about a bit.  At the end of last year we were fortunate to be able to fly back to Wisconsin and spend Christmas with Brad’s parents, his brother Joe and his family. January came an went and in February we were happy to see Wynton Marsalis and his band perform in Davis.  We also participated in a charity fun run (well…we actually walked!) and then headed down to San Diego to catch up with with friends Joan and Jacob and also Mike (thanks to Jacob for letting us all crash the superbowl party!).  March found us going to more concerts (Ballet Folklorico de Mexico, Matthew Whitaker Quintet) and Rachel getting to work preparing for her California acting debut at the Woodland Opera house.  She played a zookeeper, a foosa, and a dancing steak in the musical adaptation of Madagascar.  Joan and Jacob came up for the premier. It was really fun and entertaining.  Just prior to this we had made a quick trip back to Wisconsin for Brad’s mother’s funeral. While sad, it was good to re-connect with family members.  It also snowed there on the day after Easter, something we don’t see in Woodland even at the height of winter in California. In June we hopped up to Seattle to re-connect with friends up there.  Thanks to Sonja, Boaz and family and Micah and Patty for letting us crash with them!  It was great to see Jared and Cara again after so many years and to meet up with Brad’s postdoc supervisor Steve and his wife Jorja.  On the trip we finally got rid of our 1993 Ford Escort that had been parked outside our condo since 2007. It had become more moss than car.  After this we made a trip up to Orcas Island with Micah, Patty, Joan, Jacob, Ian and Romeny. Collecting oysters from the beach in front of Micah’s family’s home was our idea of heaven. <p>  
 <p>
Keeping with the theme of getting out and catching up with old friends, we made a trip in July to Santa Cruz to hang out with Mike, Heather, their kids and some of their friends.  Things were starting to feel a bit normal.  That month we also made it to the California State Fair (don’t be offended, but it wasn’t nearly as good as the Minnesota or Iowa state fairs). It turns out farm kids don’t take their animals to a fair in > 100° F weather. We also got solar installed on our house, which we were pretty excited about it even though the reason we did it was because we had to replace our entire roof.  The “joy” of home ownership continued with some dry rot that we had to repair.  <p> 
 <p>
By August Brad had done something strange to hurt his ankle. This gave him a distinguished limp and an opportunity to visit many medical facilities and specialists.  He is mostly okay now but still going to doctors as they are a bit stumped about what happened (Brad is happy to retain his ankle and foot and to not literally be “stumped”).  This meant that the truly fun group camping trip (thanks David and Alice for organizing!) in what is known as Hell Hole (actually not that scary, and a short drive from Lake Tahoe) involved more slow walking and less strenuous hiking than we might have hoped.  Still, it was great fun and we met a bunch of new friends on the trip.  In August we also went to a great performance of “In the Heights” at the Woodland Opera house.  In September we had more “joy” of home ownership as we learned that we had to replace all the plumbing in our house.  Between ripping walls out and replacing everything we just managed to get the house almost back into shape by Thanksgiving.  It has been a bit exhausting.  But September wasn’t all bad, we got the chance to see Weird Al Yankovic, which restored our faith in accordions, if nothing else!  <p> 
 <p>
In October we branched out into Europe to catch up with friends.  Rachel had a conference in Cologne, and afterwards we went to Paris to hang out with Minako and Owen, friends from our Vienna days who both now live in France. Lots of great food and company and some tourism as well (it was our first time to Versailles).  Then we went with Owen to Sergy, France to stay with him and Ludo for a while. This is next to CERN and Geneva.  Owen was extremely nice to play host and take us to Montreux, Switzerland and Annecy, France.   <p>
 <p>
November found Rachel volunteering at the theater (working backstage on “A Christmas Story” and preparing costumes for the “Nutcracker”). For “A Christmas Story”, she took on the role of Assistant Stage Manager for the first time, which included the important duties of running the smoke machine and throwing a large fake python onstage. We had a total of three Thanksgiving celebrations; two at friend’s houses (Thanks Karen, David and Alice) and one with family.  Rachel also went on strike in November.  As a research biologist, it makes complete sense that she is a member of the United Auto Workers union. On the 14th the University of California system workers went on strike and this became the largest strike of academic workers in US history and the largest strike of 2022.  Brad’s contract is not union represented and so he had to keep going to work and miss out on all those historic union songs and slogans (Unions: the people who brought you weekends).  After a total of 4 weeks striking, the bargaining unit Rachel is represented by settled on a contract, so she is finally back to work for December.  <p>
 <p>
What else has been going on this year?  As far as work goes, we are keeping busy.  Rachel continues with her research on cilia in Tetrahymena, and Brad continues to write more complex computer programs to analyze large DNA data sets. House repairs have kept us busy on evenings and weekends, but we have managed to squeeze in a few projects.  Brad tried his hand at making bianco vermouth (actually not that bad), and collected a huge amount of green and black olives (they grow on trees down here :)  and has tried several methods of curing them.  Rachel keeps busy with the garden and various knitting projects. Our cat Gabby, firmly in middle-age, is doing well and maintains a busy schedule of sleeping and staring at birds through the window.  


 <p> 
 <p>We wish everyone a happy and healthy new year! <p>
