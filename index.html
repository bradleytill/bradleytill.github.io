  <h1>Dear Friends and Family,</h1>
<p>Well, here we are again.  December has crept up on us and the years seemed to have whooshed by.  It seems like just yesterday we were sitting in our Seattle apartment burning CDs and printing labels for our first installment of the Christmas CD.  That was back in 2002!  The harsh reality of aging is that we now work with people who were born after this date.  That said, it is with youthful vigor that we provide you with the 2023 Christmas bonanza!  
<p>   
 <p> 
<p>As with all years past, this year has been a mix of good and bad for us and the rest of the world.  You’d think we’d be used to this by now, but there is always something new around the corner.  We'll have to muddle through somehow, as the song so aptly puts it.  What have we been up to?  We have eased into life as Californians as we pass our third year here.  We have grown soft and the mere sight of a cloud can elicit moans about bad weather.  Not really, but we were surprised the other day to be caught out in the rain on our bicycles.  When we lived in Chile the opposite was true and we would be shocked when the rain stopped!  
<p>  
 <p> 
<p>Rachel has been keeping active in the local theater.  Mostly back-stage stuff (two plays this year), making sure that curtains go up and come down when they should, and sets get properly changed.  She has also honed her acting chops playing Ursula in  Shakespeare’s “Much ado about nothing” in August in Winters, a town just a stone’s throw from Napa Valley.  She was great (truly!) and all of her sisters showed up for the performance.  Another highlight of the year was that we both got inflatable paddle boards that can be converted to kayaks.  We’ve taken these camping, to the local river, and Lake Tahoe.  We like them much better than our old two person inflatable kayak!  When not on the water, we’ve taken to bicycling to and from work as much as possible.  It is about 13 miles each direction and can be windy peddling through the farmlands, but having ebikes levels the playing field.  In addition to all this, Rachel has been enjoying pilates.  It is all an effort to slow down father time.  He may be relentless but here in California we have mother nature on our side most of the time.  <p>
 <p> 
<p>The year was also filled with a lot of fun events with our friends (camping, Oktoberfest, parties), and some fantastic concerts, shows and plays (including Cecile Salvant, SF Opera, Tig Notaro, Riders in the Sky, An American in Paris, Japanese taiko drumming, Los Lobos, Young Frankenstein, Something Rotten, Oklahoma, and a few more!).  We celebrated Rachel’s birthday with a week in Sonoma with her sisters. A highlight for Brad was visiting the Charles Schultz museum.  He’s been a big fan of Peanuts since his childhood.  Shultz had lived less than 3 hours from where Brad grew up and then moved to Sonoma, less than 3 hours from where we now live.  That’s where the similarity ends.  Don’t ask Brad to draw a cartoon..it will be a disaster.  Good grief!  <p>  
 <p> 
<p>A major highlight of the year was a trip to Europe.  Rachel attended a conference in Montpellier, France.  Brad and Rachel’s sister Shelly tagged along .  While Rachel sat in stuffy dark rooms, learning about the latest discoveries, Brad and Shelly traipsed around the south of France (Carcassone, Nimes) seeking adventure and fine food.  One reason the conference was great was that some of our friends (Marcella from our days in Oregon and Seattle, Emine from our time in Vienna), and many of Rachel’s colleagues attended.  It was great catching up with everyone.  We also spent some time in Provence with our friend Minako.  Readers with a good memory will recall that we met up with Minako the previous year in Paris. She showed us around the region and introduced us to some great restaurants!  After Provence we hopped over to Vienna for a few days.  Our first time back since we left in 2019! It felt like a homecoming and so many of our friends came out to the pubs to meet up with us.  We miss you all!  From Vienna it was a few days in Paris, a city that never disappoints.  While California is nice, we certainly miss living in Europe.  <p>  
 <p> 
<p>What else have we been up to?  Rachel continues to knit and has joined a book club.  Brad did some experiments with curing olives he picked from a tree where he works, and spends some of his free time helping scientists from different countries with their data analysis.  This is a continuation of projects he helped start while working at the UN.  Brad’s father returned to California to celebrate Thanksgiving with us.  We packed in wine tasting, the California Agriculture Museum and some musical theater.  Rachel made probably the best turkey in the world for Thanksgiving dinner!  <p>
 <p> 
 <p>On the work side of things, Rachel continues to have fun experimenting on the organism Tetrahymena.  Brad’s computer programming skills continue to expand, and he is excited to be a “Co-PI” on a research grant on alpacas that will begin in January where he will work with a team to try to unravel the genetics of coat color.  Finally, we should mention that after 15 years of practice, our cat Gabby has perfected the fine art of napping.  Wouldn’t the world be better if we were all more like cats?  <p> 
 <p> 
 <p>All the best and have a healthy and happy new year! <p> 
 
 <p>    Brad & Rachel  <p>
