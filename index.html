  <h1>Dear Friends and Family,</h1>
    <p>Well, we’ve reached the end of what will hopefully be the strangest year of our lifetime.  More than ever, we hope this letter finds you healthy and happy.<p>   
 <p> 
<p>We have plenty to report for 2020. Starting in January, before the pandemic (remember those days?), we were in San Diego for an annual genomics conference and met up with a bunch of people at the conference and also caught up with friends Mike, Erin, Kim, Joan and Jacob who live in the area. We thank Joan and Jacob for letting us stay with them while we enjoyed a bit of So-Cal before heading to Oregon to visit Rachel’s mother.  Rachel’s sister Shelly also came up and we had some quality family time eating at restaurants and not thinking a bit about viruses!<p>  
 <p> 
<p>We returned to Chile at the end of January in a good mood. The protests, which had trashed our city of Temuco in 2019, had died down and we learned that we had received a prestigious grant for a crop genetics project. What do they say about the calm before the storm?  Without going into details, we learned in February that our positions were not tenable. It was a shock and it became clear that we should leave Chile. On top of that, the protests started again. As we left from our last day in the lab in March, there was a mob of protesters outside our lab throwing rocks at the police.  We had to bicycle through this to get home. The next day the government issued a mandatory stay at home order due to covid.  At least the protests stopped. Things were surreal as we started to plan to move back to the US. Our thanks go out to our many friends in the US who offered support as we desperately tried to find a livelihood in the states. It was stressful and busy because we needed to both organize our departure from Chile and find jobs in the US.  Our good friends in Temuco: Juliana, Nico and Claudia, were incredibly generous in helping us with all the logistics of leaving a country (selling the car, insurance, banking, keeping us from freaking out). A lot of this involved standing in line for hours outside in the rain as banks and offices didn’t allow more than 2 or three people inside due to covid. We cannot thank our friends enough for helping us out!<p>
 <p> 
<p>We worked from home in Chile through June and by July we were ready to leave the country. Rachel had landed a great job as a project scientist at UC Davis in California, and Brad had a very positive interview and was waiting for a solid offer. On top of that, Rachel’s sister Shelly, who lives in Sloughhouse, about an hour from Davis, was kind enough to offer a place for us and our cats to stay while we got back on our feet. Leaving the country, however, turned out to be complicated. The movers were packing up our house and would finish by Friday.  We planned to fly on Sunday. But flights were being canceled and so we had to leave on Friday, with the movers still at our house.  As Claudia arrived to drive us to the airport we said goodbye to Nico and Juliana, who were overseeing the movers!  We got to Santiago for our connecting flight to Miami with 6 hours to spare. Two of the three flights scheduled to leave the empty international airport were already canceled. And it turns out we needed the 6 hours. The airline refused to accept our two cats!  After panicked pleading and showing a million official stamped documents we had to accept that no matter what the export/import rules were, the airline would not take them without another inspection. On a Friday evening we nervously waited for a government veterinarian (from the equivalent of the USDA) to possibly show up for work in an empty airport during a pandemic. She finally arrived, took a look at the cats, asked a few questions about what they were like (the thin one meows a lot and the bigger one is really quiet) signed and stamped some papers and after paying the equivalent of 10 dollars we were back in line to check in. By the time we got to the gate they were already boarding.  It wasn’t until we landed in Miami, cleared customs and collected the cats that we could breath easy. Our poor cat Xena was sick on two of the 4 flights we had to take to make it to California, but she made through in the end!<p>  
 <p> 
<p>Our cats slowly adjusted to life in Sloughhouse with Shelly and Tom’s dog, Toby and neighbor Ellen’s dog, Jasmine, who visited frequently. We had some nice days cooling off in their pool, but life didn’t slow down. Brad landed a position as a bioinformatics programmer at the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory and UC Davis. They were eager to fill the position and wanted him to start at the beginning of August. Once our self-imposed quarantine period was over, we spent the remainder of July purchasing a car and a house in Woodland, about 20 minutes from Davis (thanks to Brad’s parents for the financial support!). We moved to our house in the middle of August. Brad’s boss Luca, from his time in Seattle (now a professor at UC Davis), gave us an old Sub Zero refrigerator and mattress.  We also had things that had been in storage in Seattle since 2007 and we kept busy unpacking all this stuff until the end of September, when our items from Chile arrived.  We are still unpacking boxes! I know that boredom has been an issue for many people during the pandemic. For better or for worse, we are on the opposite side of this.  We are keeping super busy starting new jobs during a pandemic and trying to organize our house. We consider ourselves to be very lucky to be able to move back home and find jobs, and are thankful for everyone on both continents who have helped us out. Sometimes we forget how great people are!<p>  
 <p> 
<p>Even though we have been super busy, we did manage to have some fun this year. Check out the photos linked on this page. While in Chile we had some great times with our friends, and managed one nice trip to the mountains before the pandemic. Chile is a stunningly beautiful country, and (most of) the people are great. It is a shame it didn’t work out for us, but c’est la vie. California isn’t so bad either! We made it to the zoo and camping and had some outdoor meetings with friends in between the lock-down orders. We can’t wait for the vaccine so we can explore our state.<p>
 <p> 
 <p> We are wishing you all the best for a vastly improved 2021! <p> 
 <p>
