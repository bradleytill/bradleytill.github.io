      <h1>Dear Friends and Family,</h1>
      
      <p>Every year we feel like 12 months have gone by in a flash. This year is no different. Another unfortunate consistency is that every year we wish we could fill our letter with only happy news. </p>
      
      <p>This year was a bit of a tough one.  In March, shortly after Rachel’s birthday, her sister Rebecca passed away. It was sudden, unexpected, and a real shock. Rebecca would frequently visit us from Nevada. She filled the room with an artistic creativity that we miss.  In May, Rachel’s mother Mary passed away. We are so grateful to live only 5 minutes from where she lived. We grieve for them both and celebrate the many years of great times we had with them. </p>
      
      <p>Looking back on 2025, it was filled with a lot of friends and a lot of good times. We are truly lucky. We finished 2024 visiting friends in San Diego.  It put us in the Christmas spirit (we did watch “Hot Frosty”, and we are still recovering!).  We had a nice trip to Seattle in February to finish the upgrade to our condo there.  We wanted to sell it, but the market did not oblige, so we are renting it again.  In April we joined Irvin and Jessica’s trip to Ireland.  They had been planning it for a while and we kind of invited ourselves to the first half of it.  We’d like to think we were sort of a “lucky charm” for them.  We all had a blast in Dublin and Killarney. We’d never been to Ireland before, but we will certainly go back.  The music, scenery, and amazingly friendly Irish people combined to make a really lovely stay there.</p>
      
      <p>Shorty after we returned from Ireland, Rachel was in the play “Almost Maine” in Winters, California. After this she got the role of “Old Shady” in “Men on Boats”, a play about exploring the Grand Canyon. She was great in this role!  She played a taciturn Civil War veteran who was handy with a knife and a little too fond of the contents of his flask.  Brad got some chain mail pajamas from Amazon.  She is a method actor.   
</p>
      
      <p>This year we went to a lot of baseball games, concerts, and theater.  It is almost too much to recount. We saw several A’s games at their temporary home in Sutter Park in Sacramento and went into San Francisco twice to see the Giants. Oracle park is a great place to see baseball and we look forward to going to more games next season.  One especially memorable concert was traditional Hawaiian music by Raiatea Helm. 
</p>
      
      <p>We also did a lot of paddle boarding and camping.  We are happy that our friends Eve and Dennis also like to paddle board.  We took our boards camping to Trinity Lake in the spring (thanks to Jessica and Janis for organizing), and Brad was on the water and camping at “Hell Hole” with the whole camping gang (thanks to Alice and David for organizing).  Rachel couldn’t make that one, but she did join later in the year for another highlight: a week in Yosemite National Park.  Thanks to Micah, Patty, Joan and Jacob for their efforts in making it a truly memorable trip.  We’d never been there before and we now know why everyone raves about it.  It was awe-inspiring.  That wasn’t the only national park we made it to this year.  We rode with Rachel’s sister Shelly and her husband Tom up to Oregon for Mary’s funeral.  On the way, we stopped at Crater Lake National Park.  It had been years since we had been there (Rachel was once a park ranger there). It was lovely and brought back a lot of fond memories of living in Oregon. 
</p>
      
      <p>What else is going on?  Rachel is still looking for full time employment (but keeping busy with a few part-time science gigs).  Much like last year, Brad has been in and out of doctor’s offices. He is doing okay but there are aches, pains and other things that nobody seems to be able to figure out, so he bounces from one specialist to another. It is a bit tiring, but at least we live in a small town and he doesn’t have to go far to be told he needs to see yet another doctor.  On a more positive side, Brad has been having fun with a variety of hobbies. He has been roasting coffee regularly, making fermented prickly pear juice, curing olives, expanding his record collection, making gin and has plans for a million other hobbies.  Too bad early retirement is not in the cards!  Rachel is also keeping busy.  In addition to acting, she has been baking excellent sourdough, making kombucha, working on a kitchen remodel, and studying to become a Pilates instructor.  </p>
      
      <p>We hope that everyone has had the opportunity to find a little kindness and joy in 2025. And we hope there is much more in store for you in 2026!</p>
