  <a > <span style="color: #1f5d04"> <h1>Dear Friends and Family,</h1>
<p>Well, here we are again.  This time bidding a fond farewell to 2024.  It always feels like a bit of a mad rush to get all our holiday activities completed, but looking back we have no regrets.  It is a great opportunity to check in with you all and to reflect a bit.    
<p>   
 <p> 
<p>As with all years, this one is filled with some good and some less than good. Let’s get the latter out of the way first. One bummer is that Rachel’s laboratory is closing down in December and that means she won’t have a job come January.  She certainly feels lucky to have spent most of her adult life working on her favorite biological organism (are there other kinds?), but there are few people working on Tetrahymena and so chances of landing another position studying that organism are slim.  She is on the lookout for the next chapter of her career.  If you know of something that is a good fit, please let her know.  Brad made a career change from experimental plant biologist to bionformatics programmer some years ago.  It can be done, but it is not without its challenges.  Speaking of Brad, in the negative category of the ledger this year has been his health.  A myriad of small and unsolved issues have cropped up this year.  Nothing life threatening, but there have been prolonged periods of feeling very tired and not quite right, and then spending a lot of time in and out of doctors’ offices, getting probed, tested, scanned, x-rayed and having fluids removed.  It’s dragged him down a bit and we are hoping things improve in 2025.  The last bit of negativity we will share is that our cat Gabriela passed away this year.  She was old and went peacefully.  She was a wonderful companion.  We got her in our early days in Austria, and she made every place we lived feel like home whether in Europe, Chile or California.  

<p>  
 <p> 
<p>Now, on to the positive things.  After some months of an empty house, we did get a new cat.  Our friends KC and Ted told us of this sweet cat named Sam that was abandoned by the railroad tracks.  We brought him home, got rid of his fleas and within 48 hours he was sleeping in our bed and making himself right at home.  He’s great.  We aren’t used to such a young cat (he’s about 3).  He has more energy and enjoys biting us a lot more than our previous cats did but his quirks just make us like him more.  Welcome to the family Sammy!  
  <p>
 <p> 
<p>This past year found us driving up to Seattle (about 12 hours) twice as we had our friend Mark refurbish the kitchen and bathroom in our condo up there.  To save money we did the painting.  It was a lot of work.  We hoped to sell the condo, but the market is flat, so we will likely rent it again in 2025.  Many thanks to our Seattle friends Micah, Patty, Sonja and Boaz for giving us a place to stay.  We regret that we didn’t have time to socialize with all of our Seattle friends.  Hopefully we can be back up there for more fun in the near future!  We also found time for two camping trips.  One at Lower Bear River Reservoir with our whole gang of friends.  Many thanks to David and Alice for organizing and for quickly finding an alternative as our usual place was closed due to fire.  We had another camping trip with our friends Jessica and Janis and Janis’s sisters who were visiting them.  Also a super fun time!  We also got a chance to visit our friends Mike and Heather in Santa Cruz.  Our big trip of the year, however, was two weeks in Colombia, visiting our friends Erich and Carolina, whom we’ve known since our time in Vienna. It was our 25th wedding anniversary this year (burying the lead?), and this trip was part of our celebration.  We had a lot of adventures in and around Bogota, and a truly great side trip to the Amazon. We could talk for hours about it, but to save space, have a look at some of the photos by following the link on the left.  Thanks to them for being such wonderful and generous hosts!  We also loved finally meeting and spending time with their adorable daughter, Sophia.  <p>  
 <p> 
<p>Rachel has remained very active in the theater. This year she volunteered over 200 hours at the Woodland Opera House (she won an award at their annual awards ceremony).  She also acted in two ten minute plays as well as a production of “12 Angry Jurors” with the Winters theatre company. On the home front, in addition to baking and gardening, Rachel has also enjoyed making her own Kombucha.  Last year Brad got her a kit to make it, and she has excelled at brewing some fine quality “booch” (Brad is disturbed by this nomenclature).  The scobie has taken over a corner of the bar but as long as it doesn’t team up with the sourdough starter I think we’re safe. <p>  
 <p> 
<p>Last year a keen reader noted that most of the Christmas letter had to do with what Rachel was doing and not much that Brad was doing.  It is indeed difficult to stretch the statement “sat in an empty room staring at the wall” into a full paragraph...but this year is different.  Brad got back into distillation, and we had a fun gin distillation party (not counting the headache the next day).  Also, the trip to Colombia re-ignited his interest in roasting coffee (the coffee there was other-worldly).  He’s been roasting away and recently we had a coffee roasting brunch party that was loads of fun.  What else?  Well, this is a bit meta, but the Christmas website is something he really likes doing, even if it is always a bit of work to get it out on time.  Brad also continues to volunteer his time and genetics/computer programming expertise to assist on projects he helped develop while working at the UN.  This has resulted in 7 research publications this year, which is fairly productive for evening and weekend work.  This is good not only from the standpoint of helping address crop productivity in developing nations, but to keep his academic credentials up to date (his current job is not an academic one, and so there are few opportunities to lead research, publish or teach).  Speaking of teaching, Brad had the chance to fill-in for his colleague (and UC Davis professor) Luca and teach a few sections of an undergraduate genetics class.  He forgot how much he misses teaching and how rewarding (and how much work) it can be.  <p>
 <p> 
 <p>What else has been going on?  We’ve been paddle boarding a lot.  It is great fun.  For Brad’s birthday we had a wonderful long weekend that included time on the nearby Clear Lake, and a train ride to Oakland to see the A’s play their final season in the Colosseum (they move, temporarily, to Sacramento in 2025).  For Rachel’s birthday we went to San Francisco to the art museum and aquarium.  Thanks to her sister Jenny for driving! We also kept quite busy going to the theater and concerts. Concerts included Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan and John Cougar with our friends Eve, Dennis, Jessica and Janis, Anders Osborne (a favorite of Brad’s) and Tab Benoit with Eve and Dennis, Lucinda Williams with our friend KC, and most recently the Jazz at Lincoln Center holiday show (also modern dance, Branford Marsalis, and many more).  Theater included Sunset Boulevard, a professional production by Broadway Sacramento, along with many community theater shows in Woodland, Davis, and Winters.  Last, but not least, it was great to re-connect with our friend John Davenport, who we used to hang out with when we lived in Oregon (in the 1990s!).    <p> 
 <p> 
 <p>Well, we started this letter with some negatives, but it is clear that we have been blessed with good friends and lots of fun. It’s easy to focus on the negative, and we hope to remember to be more grateful in 2025!  We hope all of you have a year filled with peace, prosperity, and happiness! <p>
