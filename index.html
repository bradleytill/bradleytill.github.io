  <h1>Dear Friends and Family,</h1>
<p>Welcome once again to another holiday season.  For us, we are celebrating a year and a half back in the USA.  This is a bit of a record for us, as we haven’t left the country since returning.  It has been more than 20 years since we could claim such a long stretch without movin’ around a bit.  Thinking back to our time in Europe, I guess you could say we have the “wanderlust”.  Mahlzeit and gesundheit!  <p>   
 <p> 
<p>However, things did happen this year, and we were not quite hermits.  We started the new year off near Omo Ranch in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, with Rachel’s sister Shelly, her husband Tom, their neighbor Ellen and her mother Margaret (it is her family cabin we stayed at!), plus dogs Toby and Jasmine, and Twix the cat. It was fun to get away ,and Rachel made a mean campfire goulash. In March, we celebrated Rachel’s birthday with some wine tasting in Amador county, with Shelly, Jennifer, and Ellen. Rebecca joined the gang on her spring break for some bird-watching and a sunny backyard barbecue.  On Memorial Day weekend, we attempted a day trip to Stinson beach near San Francisco. Apparently every person in the bay area thought of doing the same thing, and traffic went on for miles.  By some miracle, we found a legitimate parking space and got some quality beach time. By June, we were fully vaccinated and ready to venture out.  We headed to Wisconsin to visit Brad’s family.  This was a good trip as we got to re-connect with both family and friends.  Brad’s aunt and uncle also came to Wisconsin, so it was a nice reunion. It wasn’t all fun and games, though we did get to see a minor league baseball game in Duluth where a baseball bat got loose from a batter and flew into the stands! Brad’s mother has dementia, and the year has been especially hard on his father Joe who took on the role of caregiver.  It was good to spend time with her while she was still living at home. In November it was time for more professional care, and Brad’s brother Joe and especially his wife Nicki did a lot to find Jean a good place where she could get the care she needs and to make the place feel like home. Rachel’s mother Mary is doing comparatively well, for a nonagenarian. Although the vaccines arrived a little too late to celebrate her 90th birthday with her in January, Rachel’s sister Jennifer coordinated Mary’s move from Oregon to Woodland in July, and now she is living at “The Californian”, an assisted living home only a couple of miles from us.<p>  
 <p> 
<p>We attempted an anniversary weekend getaway on Clear Lake during a peak drought in July. When the water runs dry, we are reminded that fish are biodegradable. We will have to get back there in the spring when there is more water!  Later in the summer we had better luck with a nice camping trip to the redwoods and Mendocino.  Great beaches and some pretty good wineries.  We went to So Cal (Southern California for you mid-westerners) for Brad’s birthday and had a great time staying with our friends Joan and Jacob.  We also got to re-connect with our friend Mike (from Brad’s grad school days in Oregon) and Kim and Darren (from Rachel’s grad school days in Seattle).  Yes, it was stormy on the beach, but it was great to see everyone and we had a blast (we even rode a tethered hot air balloon with Joan). <p>
 <p> 
<p>One of the things we are getting used to about living here is that most days it is sunny, and in the summer it can be really hot (115F).  Rachel has been going to town on our garden and it is now filled with cactus, agave, and succulents. Geraniums are quite hardy and bloom almost year-round.  The upshot of all the summer heat is that autumn can be close to perfect.  We went to a beautiful wedding of our friends Tracia and Isabelle in October. With all this good weather, we were excited when our friends Irvin and Jessica from Wisconsin were coming to town in October.  This happened to be the weekend when we got the most rain in recorded history -- dating back to when they started keeping track of such things during the California Gold Rush in the 1800s.  But, we still had a lot of fun, including seeing a live jazz concert by Delfayo Marsalis at the Mondovi Center at UC Davis.  Although the pandemic keeps going and making things difficult, with proof of vaccination and masking we’ve been able to start to crawl back to normalcy.  Rachel bought a bunch of tickets for shows at the Mondavi.  We’ve seen Mexican folk, Afro-Cuban jazz, Inuit Drumming, New Orleans Jazz, and gospel. Rachel also started volunteering at the Woodland community theater which performs in the historic Opera house.  Woodland is the county seat of Yolo county and you know what they say… you only live once.  Rachel was a stage-hand for Curious George, the musical.  The theater is great and we were happy to get to see Elf the musical there to get us in the holiday spirit. <p>  
 <p> 
<p>Autumn wasn’t all fun and games. We had to say goodbye to our cat Xena.  She was a rescue cat from Serbia that we got in Austria, took her to Chile and then to California.  If you are a pet owner, you know how they can make wherever you lay your head feel like home, even if it is thousands of miles away.  Xena was everyone’s friend and brought a lot of joy and laughter to our lives.  We miss her.  We are thankful that her sister, Gabrielle, is still going strong.  <p>  
 <p> 
<p>On the work side of things it remains weird to have started positions during a pandemic.  This fall the students came back to campus and things were a lot busier, but many people are still working from home and so the labs seem empty.  Rachel is enjoying her Tetrahymena research.  Brad is still adjusting to being a full-time bioinformatician.  He always has new challenging things to do and continues to learn more about programming, but misses having a job where he could work to improve lives in developing countries. <p>
 <p> 
 <p>We are looking forward to 2022, when we can hopefully travel again and connect with more friends and family.<p> 
 <p> 
 <p>We wish everyone a happy and healthy new year! <p> 
 
 <p>    Brad & Rachel  <p>
