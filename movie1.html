<h1>Over our illustrious time on this planet, we managed to find the time to make two movies. While separated by more than a decade, they each take an experimental approach to understand the complex relationship of turnips, or maybe not.  For now we have a link below for our second film “The Blurred Crusade” a ripping yarn full of sizzling gypsies (another lie). It is a bit of a hack to put this here and if you experience issues with streaming, try a right click on the bar.  This should allow you to download the rather large 3.7 Gb file.  Don’t say we didn’t warn you! We will eventually get our first movie up here, a 1990s era avant garde contemplation of earthworms (lie number 3). <p>
   </h1>

The idea behind the movie was to document our time in Vienna and an upcoming trip to the US for Brad’s family reunion.  We commissioned Brad’s long-time friend and artist Erik Pearson (https://www.facebook.com/ErikPearsonArt/) to create an art car out of his Jeep so that we could drive it across the midwest to the reunion. We tried to get as many friends and family in the movie as possible. It brings back fond memories!
